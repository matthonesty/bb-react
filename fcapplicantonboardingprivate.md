New FC applicant onboarding process:

This is a reference for the Chief HR Officer or one of their designated lieutenants for the process of getting an FC applicant from their posted application to JFC rank.

Review the application pasted in #fc-applicants. If there are glaring problems, they should be denied at this point, otherwise proceed. Banned or problematic members can and should be filtered out at this step.
Grant the user the FC applicant role in discord, @them in the FC applicants channel with a greeting, encourage them to ask questions, review the pinned documents, and figure out a time they'd like to run their first fleet. If they are inexperienced and haven't been around BB very much to gain any knowledge secondhand, consider advising them to join hunter comms and listen in to absorb the wisdom and skills of those there. Per the constitution, anyone of at least FC level may raise an issue with the applicant to the Council to have them vote on whether or not to reject the applicant.
When the new applicant has chosen a potential date and time for their first fleet, ask around to find someone with experience to backseat and organize BB assets to make it happen. Backseat FC is also responsible for updating announcements in discord and in game channel as well as pinging in #role_pings and the #pings channel when the fleet is going to happen.

After their first fleet:
Notify the applicant that they are bound by the rules and procedures in the constitution, code of conduct, and other such rules that the Council publishes.
Grant the applicant JFC discord role, remove FC applicant role, and welcome them into BB with a post to that effect in FC hangout.
DM Chaos to have him add the FC's main to the operators list of the assorted in game channels.
Advise them to create or move an existing toon into the BB corp to access assets and wallet. Advise them to @ one of the Council members as they are directors in the BB corp to make sure they get accepted and assigned roles.
To add a new toon to the BB corp (directors only):
Confirm with the player that they are the owner of a given toon. Accept their application to join corp. Any applications from non-FC characters (and we do get them from time to time) should be rejected (don't bother stating a reason why).
Add that toon's name to the FC list sheet within the Fleet Reports 2.0 google sheet as either the BB alt or additional alts within the row indicating who the main account is. Set appropriate status within the drop-down of that google sheet.
In corp management, under titles, grant Junior Fleet Commander title to that new toon.

Grant them JFC roles in Teamspeak.
Add their main character’s name and any primary alts (including BB corp alt) to the Fleet Reports 2.0 FC list spreadsheet. Set them as JFC and active and check the box that they’ve been linked the constitution document. Use the update button to get them added to the FC feedback form.
Stock welcome message:
Welcome to the Bombers Bar FC team!
There are a few onboarding tasks for you to take care of:
1. Read the BB Constitution. It’s our governing document outlining our leadership structure as well as the rights and responsibilities of those in the organization. It’s like the Terms and Conditions agreements- you’ll be held to it regardless if you read it or not. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XNdFAsyiy4FlrvA2lB2lVutKui_d6cleCiSg0-UwbI0/edit
2. Check out the pinned messages in the various FC channels for resource documents. There are some guides for how to do things as well as some rules for our staff to abide by.
3. When you want to run a fleet, find a spot on the schedule that is open and not too close to anyone else’s fleet. Put it on the schedule in discord and in the in-game Bombers Bar channel MOTD. You might want to check the NPSI calendar for any conflicts- you can schedule on top of another group’s activities, but you may not get as many fleet members.
4. Ask for a backseat FC until you get comfortable doing all the things a fleet is going to require. Once you are familiar with doing all the things required to set up and run a fleet yourself, then you may go forth and do so. This should happen after your first few fleets or so.
5. Ask questions! We don’t expect you to know all the things right away, but we do encourage learning how and why things are done.

FC Activity Audit
From time to time an activity audit should be performed on all JFCs and FCs. The loose guideline followed is that everyone should be running a fleet of some sort at least every 60 days. We acknowledge that real life can get busy and someone might not be able to run a fleet for an extended period of time or really participate in BB activities at all. As such, discretion and an amount of leniency is afforded our FC staff. That said, we would like to keep the roles tidy and make sure our FCs are actually running fleets.
Audits are carried out by a designated auditor (the Chief HR Officer or designated lieutenants). An audit should be carried out ideally at least once every 2 months.
To determine activity, there are a few options:
Option 1: search through each (J)FC in discord search in the pings channel for the last time they pinged for their latest fleet. Do math on the date to find the timespan since last ping.
Option 2: use a utility that Leila created to do exactly that automatically. The discord bot to scour for activity can be invoked by typing ">purgelist" in the JFC hangout channel (don't do it in a public channel as they don't need to know this).
Option 3: The saved fleet reports may be checked for when the last report for each FC was submitted.

Those inactive for at least 60 days are the ones to target. The activity auditor should message them in discord DMs and inquire about what they'd like to do given that they've been inactive. A form letter template for that inquiry is provided:

Dear Bombers Bar (J)FC,

If you've received this message, then you haven't run a Bombers Bar fleet in XX days and we're checking up on you and your fleet running interest and potential.

If you're busy with real life, or just taking a break from BB, or don't think the leadership role is for you, that's just fine and we'll mark you as inactive until you decide to come back. Let us know when you would like to run your next fleet and we'll be more than happy to lend any assistance required.


Sincerely,
Lord InsidiousTroll
Chief HR Officer
Bombers Bar

At that point, the auditor should try to work with the individual to figure out their next phase. If they agree that they should go inactive for at least a while, the auditor may proceed with the Inactive FC removal protocol for that individual.
If they have gone completely afk and don't respond to DMs within a reasonable amount of time, the auditor shall proceed with removal. These individuals should be listed when announcing the conclusion of the audit.
Extensions may be granted to the period of time an “active” FC may remain non-active without losing their “active” status at the discretion of the auditor, though the auditor should keep in mind that these are the exception rather than the rule. Requests for additional extensions should be judged more harshly.

When the audit has concluded, the auditor shall publish an announcement stating such in the FC hangout channel and list those removed and a basic reason why. Auditing mistakes may be referred to the Council or Chief HR Officer.

Inactivity of recently returned members
The following will be deprecated following the constitutional amendment vote.
Members that have recently returned to the FC team shall be assessed on a different inactivity period. These members shall have 14 days from the day they are granted their roles back as a part of their Returning FC Onboarding to schedule a fleet and then run it. After 14 days have elapsed, it shall be up to the Chief HR Officer or their designated lieutenants to assess the member’s situation and determine if they should retain their recently regained roles, or if they should forfeit them and return to an inactive state. These returning members shall be assessed with very little leeway granted if any at all. It is the belief of the Council that if these returning members cannot run a fleet during that time period, then they should not be asking to come back yet.


Inactive or quitting FC Removal
Once a JFC or FC has been determined to be inactive or they are leaving for a period of time, they should be removed from roles:

Remove JFC or FC discord roles from them. If there is potential for them returning at some point, assign them the Inactive FC role.
Task one of the BB corp directors with removing the JFC or FC title from all toons belonging to the inactive FC. If they are being removed due to disciplinary measures, their toon should be kicked from corp outright.
Mark them as inactive in the FC List sheet of the Fleet Reports 2.0 spreadsheet, then press the button to update the FC feedback form.
(Optional only if not a disciplinary measure) Message Abissshooter in a discord DM to pull roles from the Teamspeak from the individual being removed.

Returning FC onboarding
If a former JFC or FC has stated they wish to return to active status, per the constitution section 7.5 they must submit their request to the Senior Council Member in writing (usually discord posts in the inactive channel). Nova as SCM has delegated his power to unilaterally accept members that are of a non-controversial sort to the Chief HR Officer in order to streamline the readmission process.

The following is the process to readmit a former member:
Check what rank they used to hold in the FC list sheet in the Fleet Reports spreadsheet.
Mark them as active in the FC list and mark that they accepted the constitution.
Restore their discord rank to their former rank and remove inactive role.
Grant their BB corp toon the title according to their rank. If they no longer have a toon there, offer the opportunity to put one there.
Check that their main still has operator rights on the main in game channel. If not, DM Chaos to add their toon again.
Grant them roles on teamspeak according to their prior rank.
Remind the returning member of the activity criteria that’s specific to returning members.
Notify the returning member that by returning, they agree to be bound by the BB constitution, code of conduct, and all other rules that are published.

Process post constitutional amendment:
Grant them FC Applicant role in discord so they can schedule a fleet.
Once they have completed a scheduled fleet, restore their previously held rank or whatever rank the Council decides they should hold. (check Fleet Reports FC list for rank info)
Update the FC list with their new active status and rank.
Grant their BB corp toon the title according to their rank. If they no longer have a toon there, offer the opportunity to put one there.
Check that their main still has operator rights on the main in game channel. If not, DM Nova to add their toon again.
Grant them roles on teamspeak according to their prior rank.
Notify the returning member that by returning, they agree to be bound by the BB constitution, code of conduct, and all other rules that are published.


FC Promotion
Criteria for promotion (not including constitutional requirements)
JFC -> FC
Note to those in the future that are evaluating JFCs for promotion: beware of creeping elitism. As our collective skill level increases, it is easy to subconsciously raise the skill level required to clear the bar from JFC to FC. These are the minimum skills required to make the cut. It should be stressed that just because an individual has been promoted, it does not mean they are finished learning.

Mandatory skills:
Is believed to show competence and confidence as FC during their fleets.
Is capable of organizing all the required components of the fleet by themselves if needed (assets, roles, staging location, fleet movement, etc.).
Knows how the TS comms and permission systems work.
Channel command v fleet comms
Can use dotlan to find jump/bridge ranges and can plot a course across multiple systems to reach a target system.
Softer “guidelines”
Can comfortably run at least 2 of the most common fleet types. Preferably those that exhibit different skill sets.
Can roll wormholes and direct others to roll wormholes (especially C2->NS, which are 2 billion mass holes).
Has run several fleets during their time as JFC.
Can identify which targets to engage and with what ammunition type and ewar. When to pull the trigger.
Has been reasonably active around the time of the considered promotion.


FC -> SFC
Note: Senior Fleet Commander position is not a promotion from FC. Fleet commanders that are willing to go above and beyond what is ordinarily expected of them to manage Bombers Bar assets and train the less experienced members of the fleet command staff are granted this role as recognition of their service while actively serving in that role.

Shows an ability and desire to manage Bombers Bar assets.
Shows an ability and desire to mentor the more inexperienced members of the Bombers Bar leadership team.
Is viewed as trustworthy and competent enough to be trusted with a higher rank and level of access.
At least 6 months service time as an FC (per Constitution §3.3.3).

To promote JFC -> FC:
The following are a list of administrative steps for how to promote an individual after the decision has been made to promote them.

Grant FC roles and remove JFC roles in the teamspeak.
Grant FC roles and remove JFC roles in the discord
Grant FC title and remove JFC title for their toon(s) in the BB corp (find BB corp director and have them do this).
Update the FC list in the Fleet Reports 2.0 spreadsheet.

Infrequent cleanup tasks
These are a set of tasks that need not be performed for a period of several months given that they are usually low priority and are somewhat time consuming to get done due to the involvement of multiple people that have the requisite roles to get it all done. Once every 6-12 months is likely to be an acceptable interval between these cleanups.

Remove inactive characters from the operator lists of the main channel, BB HK, Xup, and any other channels that many FCs get added to.
Remove inactive FC characters from the access list for the BB Bookmarks folder.
Remove FC and JFC tags and channel groups from inactive teamspeak users.
Kick any very inactive characters from the BB corp if additional space is needed.
Do a thorough audit of the discord roles to see if there are any members in roles they shouldn’t be in or if any roles or permissions should be modified.
Update website content (fleet descriptions, Obombercare payouts, etc.).
Audit the Fuelwaster roles on discord and TS.

Semi-frequent cleanup tasks
These are a set of tasks that should be carried out on a monthly basis.
Harass people that still have open lootsheets to close them out. Verify whether or not the BB share has been paid into the corp wallet for those fleets. If too many lootsheets are open in the spreadsheet, then the sheet may get the queries turned off due to having too many of them.

Election cleanup activities
These are a series of cleanup tasks to perform before and after the Council elections in order to make the election process smoother for the Election Coordinator and the election as a whole.
Pre-election:
An activity audit shall be conducted just prior to the beginning of the formal election cycle i.e. prior to the electoral registration opening date. That should clear out the cruft. Anyone that does not pass that audit should be removed and therefore won’t be standing for election.
Post-election:
Prior to announcing election results, the Election Coordinator shall communicate with the Senior Council Member (who theoretically has the BB corp CEO role) to strip director level roles from any toons belonging to members not elected to the next Council.
