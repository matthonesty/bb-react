A guide for setting up your fleet and how to get roles

This is a guide you do not have to follow it

(No particular order)


Pinging for your fleets
@here this can be done in the #pings channel on discord 2-4 hours before the fleet starts, here you want to state your fleet, who is the FC, the time of forming up along with the closest trade hub, you also want to mention a doctrine (if different to standard) and any roles you will need, EG Blops, Rollers, Trucks, Hunters

For roles you can ping @here in the #role-pings channel a couple hours before your fleet, asking for specific support ships such has BLOPS or hunters.
You can cancel the fleets if you dont get enough roles any time, and let people know that the only reason you cancelled was lack of roles.

You can ping @everyone at the start of your fleet to let them know you are forming


MOTD Main channel
This is a channel shared by all the FCs and JFCs in bombers bar to not only advertise the fleets but to show the kills we have got on them. 
There is a set amount of characters we can have in this MOTD (4000) this means we have to be careful on what we put in there, as url links and kill mail links in game take up alot more characters, 
To prevent the MOTD filling up and running out of space, link the most valuable kills of the fleet, (no one needs to know you killed a 2 Mil isk frig on your fleet) after you have linked the kill you can remove the name to increase the characters again. If you are linking a url link, use a url shortener

The MOTD is the main place where we can see what fleets are happening and when. Fleets in the MOTD have right over fleets not posted.

At the bottom of the MOTD you can update it with your @here ping on Discord 2-4 hours before fleet







Fleet MOTD
Team speak info (voice.bombersbar.org), password for the channel
Link to Obombercare toon (Vova Nalentis)
Watch list info (FC, BLOPS)
Fleet staging and time of departure
Kills of the fleet
FC feed back form (https://forms.gle/ESNo3PA43kusGVgo7)
Any other information that you deem important
Ask another FC if you can steal theirs and you can adapt that to your liking

You can save your squad setup & MOTD in the fleet settings window

The Bombers Bar Corp
As an FC or JFC you have the right to put a toon in the “The Bombers Bar” corp, if you so please, here you can gain access to things like blops and rollers in 745 so you can run armadas from there, and access to bombs, fuel and BLOPS in HS, you will also have access to a wallet division where you can find some isk to help you if you need to purchase anything to make your fleet run smoother. (mention in JFC chat that you have) (mention when wallet is empty as well)

Newbro Speech
Greetings and welcome to the Bombers Bar fleet! <introduce self here>
Describe the fleet type and what it does, what bombs to bring.
Introduce BLOPS.
Anatomy of a drop:
If armada: stage on the wormhole and wait for FC's order to jump 
Mic check and get ready, listen for cyno up or take bridge
Blops bridge - link gif of how to take bridge
Align out, spread ewar, shoot primary
If ewar only, then no damage
ABC = Always Be Cloaked - if they can't see you, they can't shoot you.
Asshole taxes - if someone kills the target when ewar only is specified, charge at least 15 million isk. (At FCs Discretion)
Loot - faction, deadspace, officer, and capital mods need to be turned in. T2 and below is fair game. (anything above 10m)
Postmortem instructions - Obombercare and direct where pods should go.
Streamers - need to ask FC, put delay of >3 minutes on it, and cover overview         (At FCs Discretion)
Soundboards - keep that shit to a minimum, unless they're FC as FC can do whatever they want
How they can/cannot leave or catch up once the fleet gets going
Take questions, comments, and concerns.




Selling loot
As the FC you are responsible for collecting, selling and distributing the modules you get to the appropriate parties (HK, FC, BB) you can use the google doc loot sheet to help you with this (link found in pinned messages on discord). You can sell it quickly in Jita to the buy orders, or if you prefer, create a sell order, or use a buyback service. The loot sheet is expecting 90% of the Jita sell value in its calculations. Once sold send the isk with a reason to the hunter and The Bombers Bar corporation. 
If this does not happen, Hunters will not come back if they do not get their share and funds will dry up in the corp wallet so we can not replace ships lost, purchase fuel. Or have Obombercare

Take a copy of loot history at the end of the fleet. So you can track see who looted what if you are missing items

Obomber Care
This is a program setup to help members of your fleets cover the loss of their ship.
The payouts are linked in the characters Bio (ask if you don't know who) and only those classes of ships are covered. 

Do not send fuel refund requests to this toon.


Forming your fleet (squads and wings)
Different fleets may require different squad and wings, you are welcome to create your own or ask another FC to steal theirs. You can Save your fleet setup including the MOTD in the fleet options menu
Time slots for fleets and working with other FCs
Fleets in the ingame MOTD have rights over others, if you get intel on a fight or want to run a fleet at that time instead. Speak to the FC running a fleet, they can choose what they then want to do,

Advertising for roles for other fleets and Promotion of Bombers Bar in general
If you want too, you can make people more aware on fleets that roles needed on many fleets are vital to make the fleet happen, if they want to help out or try new roles on fleets in the future they are welcome to, point them towards discord and the Support / HK channels. If they have any questions feel free to answer them or point them in the direction of someone who can.

Promotion of Bombers Bar fleets is vital to keep the numbers in fleets up and new FCs coming in, FCs are welcome to promote Bombers Bar at their own discretion
The following are ideas that are already in use.
Streaming fleets, as FC you can choose if you want people to stream your fleets and any conditions they need to have, (stream delay, covering up fleet chat / comms / system name etc)
Twitch Bombing, linking a stream of someone playing eve online, get the fleet to watch the stream and type 07 From Bombers Bar and doing a count down and getting them to all hit enter at the same time
Talking to people in local, seeing a blops fleet tethered up on a blops waiting to take it is quite a sight for new and older players alike, you can talk to any people you see on grid in local and see if you can get them to join the fleet.
Youtube Videos, letting people record footage to create youtube videos is not only great for promotion, it means you can also look back and see what you can improve on fleets



What do I need to do to get my fleet setup / taking Xs
Ping for roles for your fleets, coordinate with hunters/ other roles on what's needed and where to go, Make sure you have fuel in desto for a Habakuk fleet and move it if you need to, Help make sure there is a way to X system (armada/Bombing fleets).

Once time to start your fleet make sure you have the MOTD and fleet setup ready to go and be on TS. Update main Bombers Bar MOTD that fleet is now taking Xs and link the X up Channel, 

(if running out of space remove some cheap kills from motd)

Once in the X up channel and the X spam has started, select someone in the chat channel and press ctrl a to select all of them, and drag them into a squad in your fleet window.

Do this 2-3 times and then get someone to take over taking individual Xs.

(some people may ask why you are inviting them to fleet, just tell them to leave the X up channel)


Inactive FCs
FCs will become inactive after 2-3 months of not running fleets, this is checked by the pings you make in the pings channel on Discord for your fleets

You will be removed from MOTD access and from the BB corp with your toons along with losing Discord and TS tags. To get these tags back you simply need to run a fleet again









Other things to note 
Once you have set off with your fleet make sure you have unset free move and only have people you trust is squad leader positions, 

Fleet comp lets you see what people are in and where they are in space give it a glance before you head out make sure there is no one out of place, and in the wrong ship

Spies
If on an armada get someone you trust to ship to scan bombers to check for unauthorized Covert Cynos. Note it is very common for recons to have Covert Cynos.
Be Aware that anybody with a squad command position can add/remove people to the fleet. Therefore if you are cautious of spies exploiting this remove the free move option and any unknowns from these positions once you get under-way
