# Fleet and Roles Guide

**A guide for setting up your fleet and how to get roles**

_Note: This is a guide - you do not have to follow it exactly. Use it as a reference for best practices._

---

## Pinging for Your Fleets

### Initial Fleet Ping (`@here`)

Use the `#pings` channel on Discord **2-4 hours before** the fleet starts. Include:

- Fleet type
- FC name
- Form-up time
- Closest trade hub
- Doctrine (if different from standard)
- Roles needed (BLOPS, Rollers, Trucks, Hunters, etc.)

### Role-Specific Ping (`@here`)

Use the `#role-pings` channel a couple hours before your fleet to request specific support ships like BLOPS or hunters.

You can cancel the fleet if you don't get enough roles at any time. Let people know the only reason you cancelled was lack of roles.

### Fleet Start Ping (`@everyone`)

Ping `@everyone` at the start of your fleet to let them know you are forming.

---

## MOTD Main Channel

The MOTD is a **shared channel** for all FCs and JFCs to advertise fleets and showcase kills.

### Character Limits

- Maximum **4,000 characters** in the MOTD
- URL links and killmail links take up significantly more characters than displayed
- **Only link the most valuable kills** (no one needs to see a 2M ISK frigate kill)
- After linking a kill, you can remove the name to free up characters
- Use **URL shorteners** for any web links

### Fleet Priority

**Fleets in the MOTD have right over fleets not posted.**

### Updating Before Fleet

At the bottom of the MOTD, update it with your `@here` ping from Discord 2-4 hours before fleet.

---

## Fleet MOTD

Your fleet MOTD should include:

- **TeamSpeak info**: `voice.bombersbar.org` + channel password
- **Link to O'bombercare toon**: Vova Nalentis
- **Watch list info**: FC, BLOPS
- **Fleet staging** and time of departure
- **Kills** of the fleet
- **FC feedback form**: http://www.bombers.bar/fc-feedback
- Any other information you deem important

**Tip**: Ask another FC if you can copy theirs and adapt it to your liking.

You can save your squad setup & MOTD in the fleet settings window.

---

## The Bombers Bar Corp

As an FC or JFC, you have the right to put a character in **"The Bombers Bar"** corp if you wish.

### Benefits

- Access to BLOPS and rollers in 745 for running armadas
- Access to bombs, fuel, and BLOPS in high-sec
- Access to a wallet division with ISK to help purchase anything needed for fleet operations

### Important

- Mention in JFC chat when you join the corp
- Mention when the wallet is empty

---

## Newbro Speech

Use this template when welcoming new players:

> Greetings and welcome to the Bombers Bar fleet! <introduce yourself>
>
> **Fleet Type**: Describe the fleet type, what it does, and what bombs to bring.
>
> **BLOPS**: Introduce Black Ops battleships.
>
> ### Anatomy of a Drop
>
> **If Armada**: Stage on the wormhole and wait for FC's order to jump.
>
> 1. Mic check and get ready
> 2. Listen for "cyno up" or "take bridge"
> 3. BLOPS bridge - [link gif of how to take bridge]
> 4. Align out, spread EWAR, shoot primary
> 5. If EWAR only, then **no damage**
>
> **ABC = Always Be Cloaked** - If they can't see you, they can't shoot you.
>
> ### Important Rules
>
> **Asshole Taxes**: If someone kills the target when EWAR only is specified, charge at least 15 million ISK (at FC's discretion).
>
> **Loot**: Faction, deadspace, officer, and capital mods need to be turned in. T2 and below is fair game (anything above 10M should be turned in).
>
> **Postmortem Instructions**: O'bombercare and direct where pods should go.
>
> **Streamers**: Need to ask FC, must have delay of >3 minutes, and cover overview (at FC's discretion).
>
> **Soundboards**: Keep that shit to a minimum, unless they're FC - FC can do whatever they want.
>
> **Leaving/Catching Up**: Explain how they can/cannot leave or catch up once the fleet gets going.
>
> Take questions, comments, and concerns.

## Selling Loot

As the FC, you are **responsible for collecting, selling, and distributing** modules to the appropriate parties (HK, FC, BB).

### Process

1. Use the **Google Doc loot sheet** (link in pinned Discord messages)
2. Sell options:
   - Quick sell to buy orders in Jita
   - Create sell orders
   - Use a buyback service
3. The loot sheet expects **90% of Jita sell value**
4. Send ISK with a reason to:
   - The hunter
   - The Bombers Bar corporation

### Why This Matters

- **Hunters will not come back** if they don't get their share
- **Funds will dry up** in corp wallet
- We cannot replace ships, purchase fuel, or run O'bombercare without this

**Important**: Take a copy of loot history at the end of the fleet so you can track who looted what if items are missing.

---

## O'bombercare

Our **Ship Replacement Program** (SRP) helps fleet members cover losses.

- Payouts are linked in the character's bio (ask if you don't know who)
- **Only covered ship classes** receive payouts
- **Do not send fuel refund requests** to this character

---

## Forming Your Fleet

### Squads and Wings

Different fleets may require different squad and wing setups. You can:

- Create your own setup
- Ask another FC to copy theirs
- **Save your fleet setup** including MOTD in the fleet options menu

### Time Slots and Working with Other FCs

**Fleets in the in-game MOTD have rights over others.**

If you get intel on a fight or want to run a fleet at that time instead, speak to the FC running a fleet. They can choose what they want to do.

---

## Advertising for Roles

### Promoting Support Roles

Make people aware that **roles are vital** for many fleets. If they want to help or try new roles, point them towards:

- Discord
- Support / HK channels

Feel free to answer questions or direct them to someone who can.

### Promoting Bombers Bar

Promotion of Bombers Bar fleets is vital to keep numbers up and attract new FCs. FCs are welcome to promote Bombers Bar at their discretion.

### Promotion Ideas

#### Streaming Fleets

As FC, you can choose if people can stream your fleets and set conditions:

- Stream delay (recommended)
- Covering up fleet chat/comms/system name

#### Twitch Bombing

- Link a stream of someone playing EVE
- Get fleet to watch the stream
- Have them type "o7 From Bombers Bar" in chat
- Countdown and hit enter simultaneously

#### Local Chat

Seeing a BLOPS fleet tethered up is quite a sight for new and old players. Talk to people on grid in local and invite them to join.

#### YouTube Videos

Letting people record footage for YouTube videos is great for:

- Promotion
- Looking back to see what you can improve

## Fleet Setup Checklist

Before taking Xs:

- [ ] Ping for roles
- [ ] Coordinate with hunters/other roles on what's needed and where to go
- [ ] Ensure fuel in destination for Haba kuk fleet (move if needed)
- [ ] Confirm there's a way to the destination system (armada/bombing fleets)
- [ ] Prepare MOTD and fleet setup
- [ ] Get on TeamSpeak
- [ ] Update main Bombers Bar MOTD that fleet is taking Xs
- [ ] Link the X-up channel

### Taking Xs

1. Once X spam has started in the X-up channel:
   - Select someone in the chat channel
   - Press **Ctrl+A** to select all
   - Drag them into a squad in your fleet window
2. Do this 2-3 times
3. Get someone to take over individual Xs

_Note: Some people may ask why you're inviting them - just tell them to leave the X-up channel._

---

## Inactive FCs

### Inactivity Policy

FCs become inactive after **2-3 months** of not running fleets. This is checked by the pings you make in the `#pings` channel on Discord.

### Consequences

- Removed from MOTD access
- Removed from BB corp
- Lose Discord and TeamSpeak tags

### Reactivation

Simply **run a fleet again** to get tags back.

---

## Other Things to Note

### Fleet Security

- **Unset free move** once you've set off
- Only give squad leader positions to people you trust
- Check **fleet comp** before heading out to ensure no one is out of place or in the wrong ship

### Spies

#### Armada Fleets

Get someone you trust to ship scan bombers to check for unauthorized **Covert Cynos**.

_Note: It is very common for recons to have Covert Cynos._

#### Squad Command Security

Anyone with a squad command position can add/remove people from fleet. If you are cautious of spies:

- Remove the free move option
- Remove unknowns from squad command positions once underway

**Good luck and fly dangerous! o7**
