# FC Applicant Onboarding Process

**Reference guide for the Chief HR Officer or designated lieutenants**

This guide covers the process of getting an FC applicant from their posted application to JFC rank.

---

## 1. Review Application

Review the application pasted in `#fc-applicants`.

- If there are **glaring problems**, they should be denied at this point
- Otherwise, proceed
- **Banned or problematic members** can and should be filtered out at this step

**Note**: Per the constitution, anyone of at least FC level may raise an issue with the applicant to the Council to have them vote on whether or not to reject the applicant.

---

## 2. Grant FC Applicant Role

1. Grant the user the **FC Applicant role** in Discord
2. `@` them in the `#fc-applicants` channel with a greeting
3. Encourage them to:
   - Ask questions
   - Review the pinned documents
   - Figure out a time they'd like to run their first fleet

### For Inexperienced Applicants

If they haven't been around BB very much to gain knowledge secondhand, consider advising them to:
- Join hunter comms
- Listen in to absorb the wisdom and skills of those there

---

## 3. Schedule First Fleet

When the new applicant has chosen a potential date and time for their first fleet:

1. **Find a backseat FC** with experience to mentor them
2. **Organize BB assets** to make it happen
3. **Backseat FC responsibilities**:
   - Update announcements in Discord and in-game channel
   - Ping in `#role_pings` and `#pings` channel when the fleet is going to happen

---

## 4. After First Fleet

### Notify About Rules

Notify the applicant that they are bound by the rules and procedures in:
- Constitution
- Code of Conduct
- Other published Council rules

### Grant JFC Roles

1. Grant the applicant **JFC Discord role**
2. Remove **FC Applicant role**
3. Welcome them into BB with a post to that effect in **FC hangout**

### In-Game Channel Access

DM **Chaos** to have him add the FC's main to the operators list of the assorted in-game channels.

### BB Corp Access

Advise them to:
- Create or move an existing character into the **BB corp** to access assets and wallet
- `@` one of the Council members (they are directors in the BB corp) to ensure they get accepted and assigned roles

---

## 5. Adding New Character to BB Corp

**For Directors Only**

### Verification & Acceptance

1. Confirm with the player that they are the owner of a given character
2. Accept their application to join corp
3. **Reject** any applications from non-FC characters (don't bother stating a reason why)

### Spreadsheet Management

Add that character's name to the **FC List sheet** within the **Fleet Reports 2.0** Google Sheet:
- Add as either the BB alt or additional alts within the row indicating who the main account is
- Set appropriate status within the drop-down of that Google Sheet

### Corp Title Assignment

In corp management, under titles, grant **Junior Fleet Commander** title to that new character.

---

## 6. TeamSpeak & Tracking

### TeamSpeak

Grant them **JFC roles** in TeamSpeak.

### Fleet Reports Spreadsheet

Add their main character's name and any primary alts (including BB corp alt) to the **Fleet Reports 2.0 FC list** spreadsheet:
- Set them as **JFC**
- Set as **Active**
- Check the box that they've been linked the constitution document
- Use the **Update button** to get them added to the FC feedback form

---

## Stock Welcome Message

Use this template when welcoming new JFCs:

> **Welcome to the Bombers Bar FC team!**
>
> There are a few onboarding tasks for you to take care of:
>
> 1. **Read the BB Constitution**. It's our governing document outlining our leadership structure as well as the rights and responsibilities of those in the organization. It's like the Terms and Conditions agreements- you'll be held to it regardless if you read it or not.
>    http://www.bombers.bar/resources (Bombers Bar Governance Constitution)
>
> 2. **Check out the pinned messages** in the various FC channels for resource documents. There are some guides for how to do things as well as some rules for our staff to abide by.
>
> 3. **When you want to run a fleet**, find a spot on the schedule that is open and not too close to anyone else's fleet. Put it on the schedule in Discord and in the in-game Bombers Bar channel MOTD. You might want to check the NPSI calendar for any conflicts- you can schedule on top of another group's activities, but you may not get as many fleet members.
>
> 4. **Ask for a backseat FC** until you get comfortable doing all the things a fleet is going to require. Once you are familiar with doing all the things required to set up and run a fleet yourself, then you may go forth and do so. This should happen after your first few fleets or so.
>
> 5. **Ask questions!** We don't expect you to know all the things right away, but we do encourage learning how and why things are done.

## FC Activity Audit

**Performed by**: Chief HR Officer or designated lieutenants

### Frequency

An activity audit should be performed **at least once every 2 months**.

### Activity Guidelines

The loose guideline followed is that everyone should be running a fleet of some sort **at least every 60 days**.

We acknowledge that real life can get busy and someone might not be able to run a fleet for an extended period of time or really participate in BB activities at all. As such, **discretion and an amount of leniency is afforded** our FC staff.

That said, we would like to keep the roles tidy and make sure our FCs are actually running fleets.

### Determining Activity

#### Option 1: Manual Discord Search

Search through each (J)FC in Discord search in the `#pings` channel for the last time they pinged for their latest fleet. Do math on the date to find the timespan since last ping.

#### Option 2: Automated Bot (Recommended)

Use the utility that Leila created to do this automatically. The Discord bot can be invoked by typing:

```
>purgelist
```

in the **JFC hangout channel** (don't do it in a public channel as they don't need to know this).

#### Option 3: Fleet Reports

The saved fleet reports may be checked for when the last report for each FC was submitted.

### Follow-up Process

Those inactive for at least **60 days** are the ones to target.

The activity auditor should message them in **Discord DMs** and inquire about what they'd like to do given that they've been inactive.

### Form Letter Template

Use this template for inquiry:

> Dear Bombers Bar (J)FC,
>
> If you've received this message, then you haven't run a Bombers Bar fleet in **XX days** and we're checking up on you and your fleet running interest and potential.
>
> If you're busy with real life, or just taking a break from BB, or don't think the leadership role is for you, that's just fine and we'll mark you as inactive until you decide to come back. Let us know when you would like to run your next fleet and we'll be more than happy to lend any assistance required.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Lord InsidiousTroll
> Chief HR Officer
> Bombers Bar
