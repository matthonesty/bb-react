# BB Code of Conduct (and other such things)

The following is a collection of rules and guidelines for the members of the leadership team to consider and follow when operating within Bombers Bar and conducting themselves within leadership and public channels. Much of this information may also be found codified within the BB constitution, but it is also repeated or summarized here for the ease of our membership.

## Description and General Orders

All members are bound to follow and uphold the BB Constitution.

**Bombers Bar is a NPSI Community.** We have no standings as a group, and are neutral to everyone. However no individual is forced to shoot/hunt/FC against his personal blues. If we are acting upon any Intel given by other groups, we have to try in good faith to go after the targets provided by our Intelgivers, and only resort to attacking them if there are no targets left or in our reach. **"Give intel first, get bombed last"**

- Everyone is free to join BB fleets or even apply as FC, as long as that person isn't banned.
- Bombers Bar is not affiliated with anyone. There are no corps or alliances supported by BB. Furthermore any form of corp/alliance advertisement in official BB channels is strictly forbidden.
- All BB fleets must be on BB comms (currently at `voice.bombersbar.org`)
- No advertisement of other channels/corps/alliances/hypernet links/contracts allowed, warn people first, then start muting, last resort banning from channel.
- Mind the character limit of the MotD :( Posting tons of killmail links is cool, but the hidden characters of a link are still there and take up lots of room.
- Fleet timeslots are claimed on a first come, first served basis. Properly space out your fleet from another fleet's timeslot as not to step on another FC's fleet. If you want another FC's slot or it looks like there may be an overlap, ask kindly as this is usually not an issue.

### Fleet Command

- Every FC can do whatever fleet type they want
- Non-cloaky/non-bomber fleets aren't forbidden, but should be an exception and not a norm.
- As an NPSI FC, you are expected to look the other way if the group goes after your blues. (Don't leak BB opsec intel).
- The FC has full discretion regarding how their fleet is run and who may attend per the constitution. The banlist serves as a guideline for all FCs as to who probably shouldn't be allowed on fleets. An FC may disregard the banlist at their own discretion and their own peril.
- If an individual belonging to a group that is banned from BB wishes to be excluded from that group ban, they may make a request to a Council member or ask an FC to refer their request to the Council whereupon the Council or Council member shall make a determination whether or not to whitelist that individual and add them to the allowed list of the various in game channels.

## Personal Conduct

- If any commander thinks a line pilot should receive a punishment or ban, they can report it to the Council.
- **People banned for awoxing/stealing are permabanned.**
- If the safety of the fleet is in danger, ban first, sort out if it was the right call later.
- FCs can personally ban people to not join their fleets, but on an FC level and can't ban for all of BB unless awox/stealing

**Bombers Bar is never about you, about what you did, about what you think, or anything like that. It is about blowing people up and having fun while doing it.**

- Even if you don't like someone, there is no excuse not to be civil. Be respectful of others and resolve your problems amicably if possible. Report problems to the Council for them to deal with, especially if disciplinary measures may be in order.
- **Don't argue with the god damn plebs!** (no arguments including FCs in public channels). The Council and discord moderators reserve the right to remove any and all messages and mute individuals involved with the argument

## Discord Channels

- Discord moderators shall refrain from deleting posts made by FCs unless it's for a good and stated reason (arguing FCs in public channels or some other unacceptable behavior, a conversation needs to be nuked, etc.). Taking a screenshot archive of a conversation before nuking is greatly encouraged.
- Follow the guidelines pinned in the various discord channels if guidelines are posted. These mostly exist to curb shitposting in channels where shitposting is banned or regulated.
- Don't post in the `#intel` or `#streaming-and-video` channels if it's not content. They are not conversation channels. Any and all extraneous content in those channels may be removed without notice at the discretion of a Council member or discord moderators.
- The only things that need an `@here` or `@everyone` ping are fleet pings in the `#pings` channel, or requests for roles in the `#role-pings` channel.
- The `#announcements` channel is for posting BB fleet schedule, BB events, or other Council approved content. Anything else that gets posted without prior approval is subject to removal at the Council's discretion.
- The `#pings` channel is for pinging for fleet up or re-pinging after the fleet's been going for a while or when switching up the fleet type. Use it sparingly. Space out `@everyone` pings by 2-3 hours so that offline people aren't getting bombarded by pings- save that for our torpedoes.
