# Delegated Duties

**List of formally or semi-formally delegated duties, responsibilities, or offices by the Council**

The following is a list of titles and general responsibilities drawn up by the Council to facilitate the operations of Bombers Bar. As they are titles created by the Council, they may be added, altered, transferred, granted, revoked, or removed by the Council.

It is likely that these roles be held almost entirely by members of the Council, but they need not be. These roles also need not be distributed to all different people - an individual may hold multiple titles if they and the Council agree to grant the titles.
